# BlockPusher : An Online IDE and Game Engine
### Adam Coggeshell | Alex Germann | Matt Grant

Video game development is an arduous undertaking, often involving a steep learning curve with many complex tools. Testing game code can be especially time-consuming, as it often requires restarting the game to test each small change to the code.

The goal of this project was to build a simple game engine that allows code to be modified as the game runs, as well as a web interface that allows created games to be easily shared. These features are equally useful to developers of all skill levels. Beginners can use any game uploaded to the site as a learning example, using the editor to immediately see the outcome of changing the code. More experienced developers can use the engine to rapidly prototype gameplay concepts and share them to receive feedback.

Rather than giving users a complex interface and a number of pre-existing components, the engine places a large emphasis on programming and only provides a minimal editor. This is a great approach for programmers and those wishing to learn programming.

This project required a combination of web and game programming and involved a number of challenges. Documentation of the engine is important for anyone wishing to use it. Security is another major concern because the engine allows users to run arbitrary javascript code, so care was taken to ensure game code was isolated and unable to take malicious actions.
